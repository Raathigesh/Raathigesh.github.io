Web projects nowadays require various number of tools and setting them up one by one could easily consume a day or two. This is where starter kits come in handy. Starter kits are more like a skeleton and they allow us to write code which adds business value rather than spending time setting up the tools. 

I have certain starter kits I come back again and again and I wanted a tool which could remember them for me so I don't need to bookmark them. 

Meet ***Propel***. Propel is a tiny command line utility which allows you to bookmark starter kits and then will allow you to clone to the current working directory with single command.

Here is a the [github repository of propel](https://github.com/Raathigesh/Propel). Let me know what you think.
