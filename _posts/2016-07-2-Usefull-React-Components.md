Here are some components and utils that will make your React developement even more enjoyable.

# React Components

## [React Date Picker](https://github.com/Hacker0x01/react-datepicker)
Feature rich, configurable date picker for react. Worked everytime without any issue.

## [React DnD](https://github.com/gaearon/react-dnd)
Drag and drop is not so easy to handle. React Dnd makes it easy with React.

## [React Ace](https://github.com/securingsincity/react-ace)
When you want a code editor in your react app, React Ace is the package you want. React ace is a wrapper
for [Ace editor](https://ace.c9.io/).

## [React Modal](https://github.com/reactjs/react-modal)
Modal dialog in react.

## [React Skylight](https://github.com/marcio/react-skylight)
Skylight makes modal dialogs easy, which is something I discovered recently. 

## [React Dazzle](https://github.com/Raathigesh/Dazzle)
Ok, I snuck one of mine in! Dazzle makes building dashboards easier.

# Util Libraries

## [Classnames](https://github.com/JedWatson/classnames)
Working with CSS classes could be tricky when you want to append and remove based on conditions. If you have a requiment to work with classes,
this package is a must.

## [Axios](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios)
Axios is a promise based HTTP client. Very nice API and I really enjoyed working with this library. You might
also want to check [axios mock adapter](https://github.com/ctimmerm/axios-mock-adapter) which makes testing easier. 

## [Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme)
If you are writting tests for your react components, which you should, do your self a favour and use Enzyme.

# Others

## [Semantic UI](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI)

As a developer, working with CSS to get things to look the way I wanted was always challenging. Things changed 
when I discovered Semantic UI. An awesome set of UI elements to pick from and they compose extremly well. Semantic UI
is also getting its official React components [here](https://github.com/TechnologyAdvice/stardust). Keep an eye for it as well.
