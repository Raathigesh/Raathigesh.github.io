I have been using ReactJS for sometime now along with Flux. Flux is an architecture facebook introduced for ReactJS applications. I was using the [Flux implementation given by facebook](https://www.npmjs.com/package/flux) in several applications. It was very minimal implementation but It gave out a pretty good idea behind Flux. 

There were various other libraries also implemented Flux is a slightly opinionated way. But recently [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) gained some attration. It tried to learn it through the tutorials at first but Redux is not very simple for me to grasp at first then after the awesome [video tutorials by the author Redux](https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux), I think I get the idea and this post is me trying to explain Redux to you.
