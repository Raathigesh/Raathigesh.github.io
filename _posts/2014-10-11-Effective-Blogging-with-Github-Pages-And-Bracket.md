I like to blog. Blogging enables to share knowledge, viewes and findings with others. More than that, I blog because it may help my future self to refer certain findings quickly. I started blogging with [Google Bloggers](https://www.blogger.com/home?pli=1). Google Bloggers is an excellent platform to get you content out in no time. Its simple, fast and effective. But I always wanted by blog to look in certain way. I love minimalistic design concepts. Bloggers is a great place to start but it will fall short if you want great amount of customizability (Atleast for me). After sometime I started looking for other options and found [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/). Wordpress is an amazing blogging platform. It's customizability often blows my mind. It's not just customizable but also super powerfull. [Wordpres powers more than 18% of the Web](http://thenextweb.com/insider/2013/07/27/wordpress-now-powers-18-9-of-the-web-has-over-46m-downloads-according-to-founder-matt-mullenweg/). I blogged for somettime with wordpress. The problem with wordpress is its not just a blogging platform anymore. It's more than that. It's a full blown Content Management System. It's a good thing for some people but if you are expeting a simple, fast and hassel free setup, wordpress could be overwhelming.

So again I started searching for alternatives and found [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). GitHub pages allowas to create static sites using markdown. GitHub Pages runs [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to tranform markdown into static website and blogs. So the result is we don't need to pay for hosting any more (YAY!!), and we get a super simple, super fast website for almost free. There are so many excellent tutorials explaining how to setup a blog with GitHub pages, So I'm not going to go into details.

But What I want to talk about is how to manage the workflow of posting new post to your github page's site using the awesome new editor from Adobe called [Brackets](http://brackets.io/?lang=en).

This is the workflow i followed so far

1. Get my blog repo using [GitHub For Windows](https://windows.github.com/)
2. Create the content using [MarkdownPad for Windows](http://markdownpad.com/)
3. Push the new content using [GitHub For Windows](https://windows.github.com/)

Not that much of a hassel but still sometimes it's too much to ask from youself after a very eventful day. I also tried using Visual Studio 2013, markdown editor plugin and inbuilt Git Support but still it felt like VS is little too heavy for the task. After some soul searching I think I found the perfect match. Yep! That's [BRACKETS](http://brackets.io/?lang=en). Brackets is a open source code editor from adobe. It's light, fast, extremely comforting to use and got a good community support with tons of plugins.

To setup brackets for our purpose, follow the below steps.

1. Down and Install [Brackets from Here](http://brackets.io/?lang=en).
2. Install the [MarkdownPreview](https://github.com/gruehle/MarkdownPreview) plug-in for from the plun-in manager. Provides live markdown preview.
3. Install the [brackets-git](https://github.com/zaggino/brackets-git) plug-in for from the plun-in manager. Allows to commmit changes directly from brackets.

And We are Done. You just put together an awesome environemnt to write blog post with live markdown preview and pust it to GitHub straight from the editor. Below is an example of live markdown preview and git support with in the editor.
