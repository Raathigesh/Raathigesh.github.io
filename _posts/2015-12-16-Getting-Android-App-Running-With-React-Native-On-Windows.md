I managed to get a React Native (RN) hello world android app running in the android emulator on my windows machine and this post is going to describe some issues I faced and how solved those. So are you ready to get your hands dirty with some React Native (RN)?

1. Download [Android SDK for Windows](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html#Other) and install it.
2. Create a system variable called `ANDROID_HOME` and set the value to the SDK installation path. E.g: `C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Local\Android\android-sdk`. 
Make sure to select the required components when installing the SDK as indicated in [this](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/android-setup.html) link. Also make sure to create a new virtual device in your emulator with the configuration mentioned in the above mentioned link. 

> When some tutorial asks me to mess with the environment variable, I cry inside beacase the default windows UI to edit environment varibles is just awfull. But I found a new awesome tool which makes handling environment variables a breeze in windows. Check out [Rapid Environment Editor](http://www.rapidee.com/en/about).
