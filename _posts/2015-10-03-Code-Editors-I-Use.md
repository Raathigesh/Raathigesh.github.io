I love tools. I'm in a constant lookout for great tools and when I see a promising one, I try them out. This post is going to be a quick look into the open source code editors I use, Why I use them, What they are good at and What they are bad at.

## [Atom](https://atom.io/)

I'm starting to love this peice of software verymuch. 

### The things I love about Atom
- Default theme is very pleasing.
- Extension eco system is awesome.
- Autocomplete is sexy looking.
- The [TypeScript plugin](https://atom.io/packages/atom-typescript). Specially the TSLint integration is lovely. If you are into Typescript, Give this a try!

### Things I would like to see improve
- The startup time. I use this in a windows workstation with 16GB of RAM but still it takes a bit of time to start.
- Intermitant Hangs. Yes! It hangs sometimes. I would love to see them gone.

### The Pluging I Have Installed For Atom
- [atom-typescript](https://atom.io/packages/atom-typescript)
- [file-icons](https://atom.io/packages/file-icons)
- [linter](https://atom.io/packages/linter)
- [linter-tslint](https://atom.io/packages/linter-tslint)
- [minimap](https://atom.io/packages/minimap)

So what about Brackets? I tried brackets around 6 months ago but I was not very impressed with it as a Code editor. It seems like bracket's target is more towards UI developers with the tight intergration to Adobe's eco system. But again I didn't try the recent releases, So I can't say much. Maybe I should give it a try again.

## [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Another fantastic piece of software excels in a completly diffent area, The server side developement. When I say server side delopment, I'm not talking about Asp.Net web forms. NO. I'm talking about what cool kids are upto these days, Node JS and Asp.Net v5. 

I use VS Code for Node JS development mainly.

### Here are the reasons why I like this editor.

- Excellent Node JS Debuggign Support
	- Feature rich editing expirience in the editor
    - Interactive Console
- Typescript support is excellent.
- Intellisense is awesome. Even for vanilla JavaScript.
- Fast as #&*(@#@&#^*&.

### Things I would like to see improve.
- Plugin Support. I know the team is working on this feature but its very crusial at this point since there are small things missing in the editor and they could be written as nice little plugins.

## Things are good so far
So far I'm happy with these two! Atom is for front end developement and VS Code is for Node JS developement with debugging. If I find a better alternative, I'll let you know. You have a better alternative? Leave me a comment. I would like to try them out!
