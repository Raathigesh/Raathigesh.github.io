I'm a big fan of Atom Editor. In a [previous post](http://raathigesh.com/Code-Editors-I-Use/) I have discussed about the editors I use for day to day developement.

Atom is advertised as a hackable editor and It truly is. When you see a missing feature, you can very easily find a plugin for it. The plugins makes atom so great because you can customize the editor entirely for your needs.

Here I'm going list all the plugins I find useful with Atom. Hope this helps you guys as well.

### JavaScript
- [Atom TernJs](https://atom.io/packages/atom-beautify): A JavaScript intellisense engine. It's a must have if you are a JavaScript dev.

- [Language Babel](https://atom.io/packages/language-babel): Enhanced ES6 Syntax highlighting.

- [React](https://atom.io/packages/react): React syntax highlighting.

- [Docblockr](https://atom.io/packages/docblockr): Write docs faster.

### Productivity/UI
- [Atom Beautifier](https://atom.io/packages/atom-beautify): Auto formats the code.

- [File Icons](https://atom.io/packages/file-icons): Adds icons according to the file type in the file explorer pane. Makes spotting files so easy.

- [Minimap Highlight Selected](https://atom.io/packages/minimap-highlight-selected): Same as above but highlight the same words in the minimap.

- [Autocomplete Paths](https://atom.io/packages/autocomplete-paths): If you are doing NodeJs developement or working with ES6 Modules, It would be a pain to figure out the folder hierarchy. This plugin is a god sent in such places.
