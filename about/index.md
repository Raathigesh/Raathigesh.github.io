I am a Software Engineer who is passionate about writing software which will make peoples life easier and INTERESTING. I am writing code since 2009. My language of choice is C# for now. I also like to play around with the new web technologies such as HTML 5. 3D is my another area of interest. Specially the WebGL stuff drives me crazy. I do have a thing for beautiful user interfaces as well.

In short, I am just another software engineer trying to do cool stuff with my super power, ability  bring insane ideas to life overnight.
